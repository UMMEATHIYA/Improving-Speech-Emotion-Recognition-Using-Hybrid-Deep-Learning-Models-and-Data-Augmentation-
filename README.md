## Abstract
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a key component in emotional computing, enabling machines to interpret and understand human emotions from voice data. This project applies a hybrid deep learning model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional LSTM (CLSTM), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Additionally, data augmentation techniques are utilized to improve model performance. The model leverages audio features such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to classify emotions in speech signals. Experimental results demonstrate the hybrid model's effectiveness in enhancing emotion classification accuracy, particularly in noisy environments.

## Introduction
SER has wide-ranging applications in virtual assistants, customer support, mental health monitoring, and human-computer interaction. Traditional methods struggle with noisy environments, limited training data, and complex emotional expressions. This project integrates CNNs and RNNs to address these challenges while investigating the impact of data augmentation techniques such as pitch shifting and time stretching.

## Related Works
Existing SER models primarily rely on handcrafted features such as MFCCs and pitch. However, deep learning models have demonstrated superior performance by automatically learning relevant features. This project builds upon prior work by leveraging hybrid deep learning models that extract both spatial and temporal features while incorporating data augmentation to improve performance.

## Background
### Speech Emotion Recognition
SER classifies emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and neutrality from speech signals. The performance of SER systems depends on feature extraction and classification models. Traditional features include MFCCs, pitch, and energy, but these may not fully capture emotional nuances.

### Hybrid Models
A hybrid approach combining CNNs and LSTMs enhances both feature extraction and sequential modeling. CNNs extract spatial characteristics from spectrograms, while LSTMs capture long-term dependencies in voice sequences. Data augmentation techniques like noise injection, pitch shifting, and spectrogram masking further improve model robustness.

## Methodology
### Data Preprocessing
The dataset includes recordings from RAVDESS, CREMA-D, TESS, and SAVEE, labeled with emotional categories such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and neutrality.

### Hybrid Deep Learning Model
- **CNN:** Extracts local features such as pitch and frequency patterns.
- **LSTM:** Captures temporal dependencies in speech.
- **Hybrid CNN-LSTM Model:** Combines CNN for feature extraction and LSTM for temporal modeling, enhancing performance.

### Data Augmentation
- **Pitch Shifting:** Alters pitch while maintaining duration.
- **Time Stretching:** Changes speech tempo without affecting pitch.
- **Noise Injection:** Adds background noise to simulate real-world conditions.

### Training and Evaluation
- Training/testing split: **80% training, 20% testing**
- Metrics used: **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score**
- Comparison with standalone CNN and LSTM models

## Numerical Experiments
### Experimental Setup
- Dataset: **10,000 audio samples** labeled with five emotional categories.
- Training conducted over multiple epochs, selecting the best model based on validation accuracy.

### Results
- **CNN Model Accuracy:** 97.91%
- **LSTM Model Accuracy:** 92.17%
- **Hybrid CNN-LSTM Model Accuracy:** 99.31%

The hybrid model outperforms individual CNN and LSTM models by capturing both spatial and temporal features effectively.

## Conclusion
The hybrid CNN-LSTM model significantly improves SER accuracy and robustness, particularly in noisy environments. Data augmentation techniques further enhance generalization. Future work includes optimizing the model for real-time applications by addressing latency and processing efficiency challenges.
